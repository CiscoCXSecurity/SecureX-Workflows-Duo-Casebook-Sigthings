Cisco Secure Access by Duo integration with SecureX
=====================================

It is of great interest to many companies to have an integrated Security architecture. That means gathering data from various sources, and bringing it together on 1 platform. This use case describes how you can bring in valuable, and crucial information from Cisco Secure Access by Duo into SecureX. It does that by leveraging SecureX orchestration, which is a low-to-no-code orchestrator, built-in to SecureX. Duo is Cisco's adapative Multi Factor Authentication solution.

Some highlights of the use case:

* Track compromised Duo accounts (has an employee been "hacked"?);
* Track Access Device and Auth Device IP and or country mismatch (find anomalies that could indicate compromises);
* Track the potential source IP of guessing password scan (find out where the attack is coming from);
* Block Duo user in SecureX threat response (take mitigation actions to minimize impact of a compromise);
* Link cybercriminals IP(s) from a NGIPS event to a Duo denied authentication log during an investigation (integrate other threat intel source (Firepower) to find out more about potential threats).
